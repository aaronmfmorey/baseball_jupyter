    "# Pythag Correlation Adjusted for Blowouts\n",
    "I've often wondered whether MLB teams' Pythagorean win estimators could be made more accurate\n",
    "by reduing the weight of extra runs scored in blowouts. Once the game is out of hand, the opposing\n",
    "team is not likely throwing their best pitchers. They might even have a position player pitching. \n",
    "My hypothesis is that running up the score in those circumstances is less indicative of true talent than\n",
    "consistently winning by a solid but non-blowout margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a blowout?\n",
    "That's a great question. Someone could probably do the math to determine at what run differential and what\n",
    "point in the game a loss becomes a certainty and the losing team moves from trying to win, to trying to\n",
    "finish out the game with the least negative impact on the pitching staff in the next game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Someone could. But I didn't. In my view, if you need a grand slam or more to tie the game, you're usually\n",
    "out of it. To simplify matters, I'm testing with run differentials of 4, 5, and 6. Less than that and it's \n",
    "still a close game. A save situation! More than that, and your sample is going to be too small to be meaningful.\n",
    "Most teams aren't playing that many 7+ run differntial games. And if they are, they're probably either amazing\n",
    "or terrible and therefore winning/losing a lot of 4 and 5 run games too.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I did\n",
    "I pulled the entire 2024 season's results from Baseball Reference (https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2024-standings.shtml).\n",
    "B-Ref wasn't being friendly about scraping with the python `requests` library (which is their right). So I \n",
    "copied the html right out of the browser's inspection tab and parsed it with `BeautifulSoup` to create the dataset.\n",
